file-encode
===========

Given a file or directory, filenc.exe will encrypt it (or decrypt it) into a password protected zip file. 
Most useful for files with sensitive information that I place on the cloud (e.g. dropbox)

Usage
=====
Encrypt a file or directory:
filenc.exe e <file> | <dir>

Decrypt a file or directory:
filenc.exe d <file> | <dir>
